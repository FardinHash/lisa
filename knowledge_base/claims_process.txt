- Check for suicide clause if within first 2 years

Approval and Payment (Days 30-45):
- Approve claim for payment
- Calculate exact benefit amount
- Process payment method selection

CONTESTABILITY PERIOD

The contestability period is typically the first 2 years after policy issuance. During this time, insurers can investigate and potentially deny claims for material misrepresentation.

What Insurers Investigate:
- Medical history accuracy on application
- Lifestyle information (smoking, alcohol, drugs)
- Risky hobbies or activities not disclosed
- Pre-existing conditions not mentioned
- Fraudulent information

Material Misrepresentation Examples:
- Failing to disclose cancer diagnosis
- Lying about smoking status
- Not disclosing heart disease
- Concealing drug or alcohol abuse
- Providing false medical records

If Misrepresentation Found:
- Claim may be denied
- Premiums may be refunded
- Policy may be rescinded
- Legal action may result
- Beneficiaries can appeal decision

After Contestability Period:
- Claims rarely denied except for non-payment
- Material misrepresentation no longer grounds for denial
- Only exclusions can deny claim
- Process typically faster and simpler

SUICIDE CLAUSE

Most life insurance policies have a suicide clause for the first 2 years of coverage.

Standard Suicide Clause Terms:
- If insured dies by suicide within 2 years of policy start date
- Death benefit typically not paid
- Premiums paid are usually refunded to beneficiaries
- After 2 years, suicide is covered like any other death
- Some states require only 1-year suicide exclusion

Important Considerations:
- Term life conversion may reset suicide clause period
- Reinstated policies may have new suicide clause period
- Accidental death riders may have different terms
- Military policies may have different provisions

CLAIM DENIAL REASONS

Common Reasons for Denial:

1. Material Misrepresentation (within contestability):
- False information on application
- Undisclosed health conditions
- Incorrect lifestyle information

2. Policy Lapsed:
- Non-payment of premiums
- Policy not in force at death
- Grace period expired

3. Death by Exclusion:
- Death during commission of felony
- Death in war or military action (if excluded)
- Death during risky activity that was excluded
- Death from aviation (if excluded)

4. Suicide (within clause period):
- Death by suicide within 2-year period
- Determined by death certificate and investigation

5. Beneficiary Issues:
- Beneficiary killed the insured
- No valid beneficiary designated
- Beneficiary cannot be located
- Disputed beneficiaries

6. Fraud:
- Policy taken out with intent to defraud
- Insured still alive (rare but happens)
- Fake death certificate
- Identity theft

BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION ISSUES

Primary vs. Contingent Beneficiaries:
- Primary: first in line to receive benefits
- Contingent: receives benefits if primary deceased
- Can have multiple beneficiaries with percentage allocations
- Always keep designations updated

Per Stirpes vs. Per Capita:
- Per stirpes: deceased beneficiary's share goes to their heirs
- Per capita: deceased beneficiary's share split among living beneficiaries
- Important for multi-generational planning

Common Issues:
- No beneficiary designated: benefit goes to estate
- All beneficiaries deceased: benefit goes to estate
- Minor children as beneficiaries: requires guardian or trust
- Divorced spouse still named: may still receive benefit depending on state
- Unclear designations: causes delays and disputes

Best Practices:
- Review beneficiaries every 2-3 years
- Update after major life events (marriage, divorce, birth, death)
- Name contingent beneficiaries
- Be specific with names and relationships
- Consider establishing trust for minor children
