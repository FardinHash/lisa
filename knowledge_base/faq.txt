LIFE INSURANCE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q: What is life insurance?
A: Life insurance is a contract between a policyholder and an insurance company where the insurer pays a death benefit to designated beneficiaries upon the insured person's death in exchange for premium payments. It provides financial protection for loved ones and can help cover final expenses, replace income, pay off debts, and fund future needs like education.

Q: How does life insurance work?
A: You purchase a policy by paying premiums (monthly, quarterly, or annually). If you die while the policy is active, the insurance company pays a death benefit to your designated beneficiaries. The benefit amount is tax-free and can be used for any purpose. Term policies provide coverage for a specific period, while permanent policies last your lifetime and build cash value.

Q: How much life insurance do I need?
A: A common rule is 10-15 times your annual income. Consider your debts (mortgage, loans), income replacement needs (5-10 years), education costs for children, and final expenses. For example, if you earn $75,000 annually with $300,000 mortgage and 2 kids, you might need $1-1.5 million in coverage.

Q: How much does life insurance cost?
A: Term life insurance costs vary by age, health, coverage amount, and term length. A healthy 30-year-old might pay $25-40/month for $500,000 in 20-year term coverage. A 50-year-old might pay $150-250/month for the same coverage. Permanent policies cost significantly more, often 5-10 times term life rates, but last your lifetime and build cash value.

Q: What's the difference between term and permanent life insurance?
A: Term life provides coverage for a specific period (10-30 years) at lower cost but expires at term end with no cash value. Permanent life (whole, universal, variable) lasts your lifetime, costs more, builds cash value you can borrow against, and has level premiums. Term is best for temporary needs; permanent for lifetime protection and estate planning.

Q: Do I need life insurance if I'm single with no dependents?
A: It depends on your situation. Consider life insurance if you have debts others might inherit (co-signed loans, business debts), want to cover funeral expenses ($7,000-25,000), help aging parents financially, or lock in low rates while young and healthy. If you're financially independent with no obligations, you may not need coverage.

Q: Can I have multiple life insurance policies?
A: Yes, you can have multiple policies from different companies or policy types. Many people combine employer group life with individual policies, or have both term and permanent coverage. There's no limit on how many policies you can own, as long as the total coverage is justified by your financial situation and insurable interest.

POLICY SELECTION

Q: What type of life insurance is best for me?
A: It depends on your needs and budget. Term life is best for temporary needs (mortgage protection, income replacement while kids are young) due to affordability. Whole life is best for lifetime coverage and estate planning. Universal life offers flexibility in premiums and coverage. Consider your age, budget, coverage duration needed, and whether you want cash value accumulation.

Q: Should I get life insurance through my employer or buy my own?
A: Employer group life is often free or low-cost (typically 1-3x salary), but it's usually not enough coverage and you lose it when you leave the job. Buy individual coverage for adequate protection you control. Use employer coverage as a supplement, not your primary protection. Individual policies are portable and remain with you regardless of employment.

Q: What is guaranteed issue life insurance?
A: Guaranteed issue life insurance accepts anyone regardless of health without medical exams or health questions. Coverage is typically limited ($5,000-$25,000) with higher premiums. It usually has a graded death benefit, meaning full benefits aren't paid if death occurs in the first 2-3 years (premiums are refunded instead). Best for those with serious health issues who can't qualify for traditional coverage.

Q: What is a life insurance rider?
A: A rider is an add-on benefit to your base policy, providing extra coverage or features. Common riders include: accelerated death benefit (access benefits if terminally ill), waiver of premium (premiums waived if disabled), accidental death benefit (extra payout if death by accident), child term rider (coverage for children), and guaranteed insurability (buy more coverage without medical exam).

ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATION

Q: What medical conditions affect life insurance eligibility?
A: Most conditions don't automatically disqualify you but may increase premiums. Well-controlled conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol are usually acceptable. More serious conditions like cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, or HIV require specialized underwriting. Terminal illnesses may result in denial. Recent cancer diagnoses typically require 2-5 years remission before approval.

Q: Can I get life insurance if I smoke?
A: Yes, but premiums are 2-3 times higher than non-smokers. This includes cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and vaping. You must be tobacco-free for 12+ months to qualify for non-smoker rates. Insurers test for nicotine and cotinine. Never lie about tobacco use as it can void your policy if discovered during the contestability period.

Q: Do I need a medical exam for life insurance?
A: It depends on the policy type and coverage amount. Traditional fully underwritten policies typically require exams for coverage over $250,000. Simplified issue policies require only health questions without an exam, usually up to $500,000. Guaranteed issue policies require neither exams nor health questions but offer limited coverage ($5,000-$25,000) at higher rates.

Q: How long does the application process take?
A: Simplified issue policies can be approved in 24-48 hours. Traditional policies with medical exams typically take 4-6 weeks: exam scheduling (1 week), exam completion (1 week), underwriting review (2-4 weeks). Complications like medical records requests can extend this to 8-12 weeks. Guaranteed issue policies are often approved within days.

Q: Can I be denied life insurance?
A: Yes, insurers can deny applications based on health conditions, risky occupations, dangerous hobbies, poor driving records, or other risk factors. Common denial reasons include terminal illness, recent serious health events, active cancer, uncontrolled diabetes, severe mental health issues, or drug/alcohol abuse. Declines aren't permanent—you may qualify later as health improves or through guaranteed issue policies.

Q: What if I was denied life insurance?
A: If denied, request the specific reason in writing. Options include: apply with different insurers (underwriting varies), wait and reapply when health improves, consider guaranteed issue policies, look into group policies through employers or associations, or explore final expense insurance. Working with an independent broker helps find insurers more lenient toward your specific condition.

PREMIUMS AND PAYMENTS

Q: What determines my life insurance premium?
A: Key factors include: age (younger = lower rates), health status, tobacco use (smokers pay 2-3x more), gender (women pay less), coverage amount, policy type, term length, family medical history, occupation, hobbies, driving record, and height/weight ratio. You have no control over age and gender, but improving health, quitting tobacco, and choosing appropriate coverage can lower costs.

Q: Can my life insurance premium increase?
A: It depends on policy type. Term life has guaranteed level premiums for the entire term. Whole life has fixed premiums that never change. Universal life premiums can vary based on policy performance. Renewable term policies have much higher premiums at renewal. Return-of-premium term has higher fixed premiums. Annual renewable term increases each year. Read your policy to understand if premiums can change.

Q: What happens if I miss a premium payment?
A: You typically have a grace period of 30-31 days to pay without losing coverage. If you miss payment after the grace period, your policy lapses. Some policies have automatic premium loan features that borrow from cash value to cover missed payments. You can usually reinstate a lapsed policy within 3-5 years by paying back premiums, interest, and possibly undergoing new underwriting.

Q: Can I reduce my life insurance premiums?
A: Yes, several strategies: improve your health before applying (lose weight, lower blood pressure, cholesterol), quit tobacco for 12+ months, choose term over permanent, select longer terms (20-year often cheaper per year than 10-year), reduce coverage amount, remove unnecessary riders, pay annually instead of monthly (saves 5-8%), or shop multiple insurers through a broker.

Q: What is return-of-premium term life insurance?
A: ROP term life returns all premiums paid if you outlive the term. It costs 50-100% more than regular term but gives you money back if you don't die during the term. It's essentially a form of forced savings. Best for those who want coverage but want premiums back if not used. Regular term with invested difference often provides better returns.

BENEFICIARIES

Q: Who can I name as a beneficiary?
A: You can name anyone: spouse, children, parents, siblings, friends, partners, charities, or trusts. For individuals, provide full legal name, relationship, Social Security number, and contact information. You can name multiple beneficiaries with percentage allocations. Always name contingent beneficiaries in case primary beneficiaries die before you. Minor children should have benefits directed to a trust or guardian.

Q: Should I name my estate as beneficiary?
A: Generally no. Naming your estate as beneficiary subjects the death benefit to probate, delays distribution, exposes funds to creditors and estate taxes, and incurs legal fees. Better to name individuals or a trust as beneficiaries. Only name estate if no living beneficiaries exist or for specific estate planning purposes under attorney guidance.

Q: Can I change my beneficiary?
A: Yes, you can typically change beneficiaries anytime (unless designated as irrevocable). Contact your insurer for a beneficiary change form, complete it, and return it to the company. Changes take effect when the company processes the form. Review beneficiaries every 2-3 years and after major life events (marriage, divorce, births, deaths). Keep a copy of all beneficiary designation forms.

Q: What happens if my beneficiary dies before me?
A: If your primary beneficiary dies before you, benefits pass to contingent beneficiaries. If no contingent beneficiaries exist or they're also deceased, benefits typically go to your estate. This subjects funds to probate and creditors. Always name contingent beneficiaries and keep designations current to avoid these issues.

Q: What is an irrevocable beneficiary?
A: An irrevocable beneficiary cannot be changed without their consent. They have permanent rights to the death benefit. This is rare and typically used in divorce settlements, business agreements, or when required by court order. Most beneficiaries are revocable, meaning you can change them anytime without their permission or knowledge.

CASH VALUE AND POLICY LOANS

Q: What is cash value in life insurance?
A: Cash value is a savings component in permanent life insurance policies that accumulates over time. A portion of your premium payments go toward building cash value, which grows tax-deferred. You can borrow against it, withdraw it, or use it to pay premiums. Cash value grows slowly in early years and accelerates later. Term life has no cash value.

Q: Can I borrow money from my life insurance?
A: Yes, if you have a permanent policy with sufficient cash value. Policy loans are easy to obtain with no credit check or approval process. You're borrowing from the policy's cash value, not the insurer. Interest rates are typically 5-8%. Loans don't need to be repaid during your lifetime, but unpaid loans reduce the death benefit. If loans exceed cash value, the policy can lapse.

Q: What happens if I surrender my life insurance policy?
A: Surrendering means canceling the policy and taking the cash value. You'll receive the cash surrender value, which is cash value minus any surrender charges (common in first 10-15 years). The policy ends and beneficiaries receive nothing. Surrender value may be taxable if it exceeds premiums paid. Consider alternatives like reducing coverage, using cash value for premiums, or policy loans before surrendering.

Q: Can I use my life insurance cash value while alive?
A: Yes, with permanent policies you can: take policy loans (borrowed against cash value), make withdrawals (reduces death benefit), use cash value to pay premiums, surrender the policy for cash value, or use it as collateral for bank loans. Many people use cash value for retirement income, emergency funds, or major expenses. Term policies have no cash value to access.

CLAIMS AND DEATH BENEFITS

Q: How do beneficiaries file a life insurance claim?
A: Beneficiaries should: 1) Contact the insurance company's claims department, 2) Request claim forms, 3) Obtain certified death certificate (multiple copies), 4) Complete claim forms with policy details, 5) Submit forms and death certificate, 6) Provide identification and relationship proof, 7) Await review (typically 30-60 days), 8) Receive death benefit payment. Keep copies of all documents submitted.

Q: How long does it take to receive life insurance benefits after death?
A: Straightforward claims typically pay within 30-60 days of submission. Claims during the 2-year contestability period may take 60-90 days due to investigation. Complications (missing documents, disputed beneficiaries, investigations) can extend this to several months. Most states require insurers to pay within 30-60 days or pay interest on delays.

Q: Are life insurance death benefits taxable?
A: Death benefits are generally income tax-free to beneficiaries. However, interest earned on benefits held by the insurer is taxable. If the estate is the beneficiary, benefits may be subject to estate tax if the estate exceeds $13.61 million (2025 limit). Policy loans outstanding reduce the death benefit. If you transfer a policy for value, benefits may become taxable.

Q: Can a life insurance claim be denied?
A: Yes, claims can be denied for: material misrepresentation on the application (within 2-year contestability period), policy lapsed due to non-payment, death by suicide within first 2 years, death from excluded activities, beneficiary killed the insured, or fraud. After the contestability period, claims are rarely denied except for non-payment. Denials can be appealed through internal appeals, state insurance department complaints, or legal action.

Q: What is the contestability period?
A: The contestability period is the first 2 years after policy issuance when insurers can investigate claims for material misrepresentation or fraud. If the insurer discovers false information on the application that would have affected the decision to issue coverage or the premium rate, they can deny the claim or rescind the policy. After 2 years, policies are generally incontestable except for non-payment.

SPECIAL SITUATIONS

Q: What happens to my life insurance in a divorce?
A: Life insurance doesn't automatically change with divorce. If your ex-spouse is the beneficiary, they remain the beneficiary unless you change it (except in some states where divorce automatically revokes spousal beneficiary designation). Divorce decrees often require one spouse to maintain coverage with the other or children as beneficiaries. You may be able to split cash value in permanent policies. Review and update beneficiaries immediately after divorce.

Q: Can I get life insurance on someone else?
A: You can only get life insurance on someone if you have "insurable interest"—you would suffer financial loss from their death. Examples include: yourself, your spouse, minor children, business partners, or key employees. The insured person must consent and sign the application. You cannot secretly insure someone. The person being insured must participate in the application process.

Q: What is key person insurance?
A: Key person insurance is life insurance a business purchases on the life of a critical employee, owner, or executive whose death would cause financial hardship. The business is the policy owner and beneficiary. The death benefit helps cover costs of recruiting/training a replacement, lost revenue, reassuring investors and creditors, and buying out a deceased owner's share. Premiums are not tax-deductible but benefits are usually tax-free.

Q: Do I need life insurance if I'm retired?
A: It depends on your situation. You may need life insurance in retirement if: you have a spouse who depends on your pension/income, you have debts or a mortgage, you want to leave an inheritance, you need to cover estate taxes, you want to cover final expenses, or you have a special needs dependent. If you're financially secure with no dependents or debts, you may not need coverage.

Q: Can I keep my group life insurance if I leave my job?
A: Usually no, but most group policies offer a conversion option allowing you to convert to an individual policy (usually whole life) within 31 days of leaving without a medical exam. Converted policies are typically more expensive than buying new individual coverage if you're healthy. If you have health issues, conversion can be valuable. Some policies offer portability, allowing you to take the coverage with you at group rates.

Q: What is burial insurance?
A: Burial insurance, also called final expense insurance, is a small whole life policy ($5,000-$35,000) designed to cover funeral costs, medical bills, and final expenses. It features guaranteed acceptance or simplified underwriting, no medical exam, quick approval, affordable premiums for seniors, and immediate or graded death benefits. It's popular among seniors (50-85) who want to relieve family of funeral cost burdens without leaving them debt.
